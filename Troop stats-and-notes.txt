----------------------------------------------------------------------

1 - Components

Attack (A): Damage output
Defense (D): Mitigates incoming damage
Lethality (L): Percentahe of attack that translates into actual damage
Health (H): Amount of damage a troop can sustain before being killed.

1.2 Base Stat Bonuses

Stat Bonuses - % increase applied to each base stat

Effective Stats (ES) - 
  - ES = Base Stat(1 + (Stat Bonus %/100))

Boosts

1.3 - Expedition Skills

Static Skills: Always active & directly modify stats or add passive effects
RNG Skills: Have a probabiility to activate during attacks. (Stuns, additional damage, damage reduction)
  - i.e., Poison Harpoon

Skill Categories

- Damage Multipliers: Increase attack damage (i.e., Battle Manifesto)
- Defense Boosts: Enhance troop defense (i.e., Vigor Tactics)
- DoT (Damage over time): Ongoing damage effects (i.e., Iron Strength)
- Burst Damage (Sudden spikes in damage, i.e., Poison Harpoon)
- Stuns: Temporarily disable enemy from attacking for x amount of turns (i.e., Onslaught, Expert Swordsmanship)
- Damage Taken Reduction: Decrease incoming damage

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3 - Damage Calculation Formulas

Before calculating dmg, determine each troops ES by applying their stat bonuses

--- Definitions ---

Effective Stats = ES

Effective Attack = EA
Defense = ED
Lethality = EL
Health = EH

BA = Base Attack
BD = Defense
BL = Lethality
BH = Health

AB = Attack Bonus
DB = Defense Bonus
LB = Lethality Bonus
HB = Health Bonus

--------------------

3.1 - Effective Stats

EA = BA(1 + (AB % / 100))
ED = BD(1 + (DB % / 100))
EL = BL(1 + (LB % / 100))
EH = BH(1 + (HB % / 100))

E.g., Dave's Infantry have a base attack (BA) of 10 and Attack Bonus (AB) of 904.6 (+%)
    - EA = 10(1 + (904.6/100))
      - EA = 10(1+ 9.046)
        - EA = 10(10.046)
          - EA = 100.46


3.2 - Special Bonuses
Conditional multipliers based on troop type interactions

Special Bonuses:
- 1.10 if Infantry attacks Lancers
- 1.10 if Lancer attacks Marksman
- 1.10 if Marksman attacks Infantry
- 1.00 otherwise

Further explained:
- Base Bonus is 1.0 (none)
  - Infantry deal + 10% damage to Lancers
  - Lancers deal + 10 % damage to Marksmen
  - Marksmen deal + 10 % damage to Infantry


3.3 - Expedition Skill Modifiers
These are multiplicative factors derived from expedition skills (static and probabilistic)

Calculating Expected Mulitpliers (EM) for Probabilistic Skills:

EM = sum of (probability x multiplier)

E.g., Poison Harpoon (50% chance to deal 50% increased damage) & Dosage Boost (25% chance to deal + 200% damage)
EM = (0.5 x 1.5) + (0.25 x 2)
EM = 1.75

Aggregated Multipliers:

Multiply all expected multipliers to get the Total Expedition Skill Modifier (ESM)

ESM = Coprod of all expected multipliers

3.4 - Damage Mitigation
Incoming damage is reduced based on enemy's EFFECTIVE defense

Dave's example DMF:
Step 1: Find BD for each troop type.
IBD = 13
LBD = 11
MBD = 10

Step 2: Find 

Step 2: Find ED


Infantry: Base defense


DMF = 1 / (1 + (WAL

Mitigated Damage = Raw Damage x Damage Mitigation Factor
