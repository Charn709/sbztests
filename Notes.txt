Apply Damage Over Time (DoT) Effects



--- Damage Calculation Steps - Step 1

Base Stats/Effective Stats
... need to be calculated for all three troop types as the EA/ED/EL/EH for infantry will not be the same as for marksman. 
All this is is taking the base troop stat (i.e., for T10 Infantry - Attack: 10; Defense: 13; Lethality: 10; Health: 15) and applying the players bonus stats.


ALL TROOPS/STATS: 
Effective Stat = Base Stat × (1 + Stat Bonus / (Stat Bonus + 100)

-Example:

SBZ Dave

Effective Attack:
EA = Base Attack × (1 + Attack Bonus / (Attack Bonus + 100))
= 10 x (1 + 903.4 / (903.4 + 100))
= 19

EA = 10 x (1 + 903.4/100)
EA = 10 x (1 + 9.03)
EA = 10 x (10.03)
EA = 100.34

Dave's Infantry have an "effective" attack of 19 compared to the base of 10.

Do this for the rest of the stats...

Effective Defense
ED = 13 x (1+690.5/100)
690.5/100 = 6.905
ED = 13 x (1 + 6.905)
ED = 13 x 7.905
ED = 102.76

Dave's Infantry have an "effective" defense of 24.36 compared to the base of 13.

Effective Lethality - 1065.1
EL = 10 x (1+1065.1/100)
EL = 10 x (1 + 10.65)
EL = 10 x 11.65
EL = 116.5


Effective Health - 1281.8
EH = 15 × (1 + 1281.8/100)
EH = 15 x (1 + 12.81)
EH = 15 x 13.81
EH = 207.15


To make it more simple... every 100% in bonus = +1 base stat
Attack with 300% (you get this in your battle report) will be +3. So your base attack is 13 vs the normal damage of 10.



------------------ Part 2 --- Base Damage; tying it together

Base Damage = (EA - (ED × 0.5)) × Special Bonus × Expedition Skill Multiplier × Troop Skill Multiplier × Additional Damage Multiplier

ED x 0.5 is more or less just a "theory" to try and match actual battle mechanics--
this prevents the defenders defense from overpowering the offense. I'm still playing around with these numbers.

So... (EA - (ED x 0.5)) is essentially the attackers capability after subtracting the defensive capability.

(EXAMPLE LATER ON)
------------------ Part 3 --- SB, ESM

SB = Special bonuses - certain advantages one troop type holds over the other
- i.e., Infantry dealing extra 10% damage to Lancers ---> this is something we already know. One of the few things that the game actually tells us.
SB for Infantry over Lancer would be an SB of 1.10

When doing the calculations, Infantry vs Infantry would be an SB of 1.00

ESM - Expedition Skill Multipliers
- From skills like "Positional Battler" - 25% damage (static skills only, not probabilistic)
Positional Battler = 1 + 25 / 100 = 1.25

--------------- Part 4 --- TSM, ADM - Only add these to figure out your damage + RNG damage



ADM = Additional Damage Multiplier
i.e., skills like Volley


CONTINUE LATER







--- Effective Stats
 (i.e., the "final" troop stat with bonus applied)
Effective Stat = Base Stat x (1 + (Stat Bonus) / (Stat Bonus + 100))

Attack (EA) -
EA = Base Attack x (1 + Attack Bonus / (Attack Bonus + 100))

Defense (ED) -
ED = Base Defense x (1 + Defense Bonus / (Defense Bonus + 100))

Lethality - 
EL = Base Lethality x (1 + Lethality Bonus / (Lethality Bonus + 100))

Health (EH) - 
EH = Base Health x (1 + Health Bonus Total / (Health Bonus Total + 100))

Let's take Dave's stats/skills for defense & Brabos stats for offense. Widget bonuses have already been added to the stats.

Damage Dealt = (EA*N*L*SB*ESM) * (DM) + BD + DoT

BA = Base Attack
IBA = Infantry Base Attack
LBA = Lancer Base Attack
MBA = Marksman Base Attack

BD = Base Defense
IBD = Infantry BD
LBD = Lancer BD
MBD = Marksman BD

AB = Attack Bonus % / 100
IAB = Infantry AB
LAB = Lancer AB
MAB = Marksman AB

LB = Lethality Bonus % / 100
ILB = Infantry LB
LLB = Lancer LB
MLB = Marksman LB

DB = Defense Bonus % / 100
IDB = Infantry DB
LDB = Lancer DB
MDB = Marksman DB


EA = Effective Attack (BA x (1 + Attack Bonus)
IEA = Infantry EA
LEA = Lancer EA
MEA = Marksman EA

N = Number unis per troop type
IN = Infantry # troops
LN = Lancer # troops
MN = Marksman # troops

L = Lethality
- Lethalitty = (Lethality/100)

H = Health

SB = Special Bonuses 
- Conditional multipliers based on troop type interactions
- i.e., Infantry attacking Lancers get + 10% damage. SB = 1.10

ESM = Expedition Skill Multipliers
- Aggregated multipliers from expedition skills
- Includes flat and RNG damage increases
- i.e., +25% damage dealt --> ESM = 1.25

DM = Defense mitigation
- 1/1+ED/100
- This scales damage based on enemy defense

BD = Burst Damage
- Additional damage from skills like "Dosage Boost" (25% chance to deal 200% damage)
- Calculated as: BD = Base Damage x Probability x Multiplier

DoT = Damage Over Time Damage
- Ongoing damage from skills like "Pyromaniac" (All troops attack have a 20% chance of setting the target on fire, dealing 40% damage per turn for 3 turns)
- Calculated per turn and accumulated over the duration

Stun Probability/Mechanics = SP 
- Modeled as turn skipping for the affected troops. This reduces the opponents damage output in subsequent turns.
- Effective Damage = Damage Dealt x (1 - SP)

Overkill and Cumulative Damage
- Mechanism to carry over excess damage once a troop's health is depleted, allowing it to impact subsequent troops
- Excess Damage = ED

ED = Damage Dealt - (N + H)
- Additional Troop Losses = ED/Health


Daves Troops EA: 351.166

Infantry: 100.46
IEA = BA x (1 + IAB) = BA x ILB
100.46 = 10 x (1 + 9.046) = 10 x 10.046

Lancer: 120.996
13 x (1 +8.308) = 13 x 9.308 = 120.996

Marksman: 129.71
14 x (1+8.265) = 14 x 9.265 = 129.71

Total Effective Attack = Sum of all troop types EA

EA = 351.166

Lethality Impact:
- Average Lethality (per troop type):
WAL = Weighted Average Lethality
WAL = (IBA x IN) + (LBA x LN) + (MBA x MN) / Total Troop Count
- For this report..
(10 x 331,624) + (14 x 317,817) + (15 x 50,366) / 699,807
= approx 12.18


--- Damage Mitigation
Damage Mitigation Factor = DMF
Brabo DB's = IDB 690.5%, LDB 615.0%, MDB 661.5%
Average DB for Brabo = (690.5+615+661)/3 = 655.67
ADB = 655.67

DMF = 1/(1+(ADB/100))
Brabo - 
DMF = 1 / (1 + (655.67/100))
DMF = approx 0.133

--- Final Damage Calculation:

Damage Dealt = EA x WAL x SB x ESM x DMF
